This guide outlines the most common causes of TotalAV malfunctions and provides a comprehensive list of troubleshooting steps to help you resolve these problems and restore full functionality.

Common Symptoms
---------------

When TotalAV is not working correctly, users may experience one or more of the following symptoms:

- Application fails to launch
- Scans do not complete or get stuck
- Real-time protection is turned off and cannot be enabled
- The application crashes or freezes frequently
- Update errors or failure to connect to the server
- Sluggish system performance after installing TotalAV

Identifying the root cause is key to applying the correct solution. The following sections provide step-by-step guidance based on various problem scenarios.

Initial Checks
--------------

Before diving into advanced troubleshooting, perform these initial checks:

- Restart your computer or device
- Ensure your internet connection is active and stable
- Confirm that your device meets TotalAV's system requirements
- Make sure your operating system is up to date
- Check if there are any temporary system errors by reviewing recent activity

Basic Troubleshooting Steps
---------------------------

These general steps resolve many TotalAV issues without advanced technical intervention.

**Step One: Close and Reopen TotalAV**

Sometimes, TotalAV may encounter a temporary glitch during startup. Close the application completely:

- On Windows or macOS, use the Task Manager or Activity Monitor to ensure the process has ended
- Reopen the application and check for improved performance

**Step Two: Reboot Your Device**

Restarting clears memory and resets temporary system processes. Many minor software issues are resolved after a fresh reboot.

**Step Three: Disable Conflicting Software**

If you have other antivirus or security tools installed, they may conflict with TotalAV. Temporarily disable or uninstall any third-party security software to see if this resolves the issue.

**Step Four: Update TotalAV**

If your installation is outdated, it may not function properly. To check for updates:

- Open TotalAV (if accessible)
- Navigate to the settings or dashboard area
- Select the update option to initiate a manual check

If the application is unresponsive, consider reinstalling it with the latest version (explained below).

Advanced Troubleshooting
------------------------

If basic steps do not resolve the issue, proceed with the following methods.

**Method One: Reinstall TotalAV**

A clean reinstall can resolve corrupted files or installation errors.

1. Uninstall TotalAV from your device:
   - On Windows: Use the Control Panel or Settings > Apps to uninstall
   - On macOS: Move TotalAV to the Trash from the Applications folder
   - On Android or iOS: Delete the app as you would any other application

2. Restart your device

3. Re-download the latest version of TotalAV from the official source

4. Install the application and log in with your existing credentials

**Method Two: Check for System Conflicts**

Some background processes or system services may interfere with TotalAV:

- On Windows, check for security-related background services (e.g., Windows Defender, firewall rules)
- On macOS, verify that full disk access and necessary permissions are granted to TotalAV
- On mobile devices, ensure the app has appropriate permissions such as storage access and background activity

**Method Three: Review Real-Time Protection Settings**

If real-time protection is disabled:

- Open TotalAV and go to the settings panel
- Locate the real-time protection toggle
- Attempt to re-enable the feature

If the toggle fails, this could be due to a subscription issue or a blocked background service. Reinstalling TotalAV often resolves this.

**Method Four: Clear Cache and App Data (Mobile Devices)**

On Android:

- Go to device Settings > Apps > TotalAV
- Tap on “Storage”
- Select “Clear Cache” and “Clear Data”
- Restart the app and log in again

**Method Five: Check License Status**

In some cases, TotalAV may become partially disabled if your subscription has expired or failed to authenticate. To verify:

- Log into your TotalAV account
- Check your subscription status
- Renew or reactivate if needed

If your subscription is active but features are still locked, contact TotalAV support directly for assistance.

Permissions and Access Issues
-----------------------------

Certain system settings can block TotalAV from functioning properly. These are particularly relevant on macOS and mobile platforms.

**On macOS:**

- Open System Preferences > Security & Privacy
- Go to the “Privacy” tab
- Ensure TotalAV has Full Disk Access and access to Notifications
- Restart the application after applying changes

**On Android and iOS:**

- Open device Settings
- Navigate to the app permissions section for TotalAV
- Enable permissions related to storage, network, and background activity

Performance Problems
--------------------

If TotalAV causes noticeable slowdowns:

- Check if multiple scans are running simultaneously
- Disable scheduled scans during high-performance tasks
- Reduce background processes or heavy apps running alongside TotalAV
- Ensure your system hardware meets or exceeds minimum requirements

Preventing Future Issues
------------------------

To avoid recurring problems:

- Keep your software and operating system updated regularly
- Avoid using multiple antivirus programs at the same time
- Back up important settings and files before making changes
- Use trusted sources only when downloading or reinstalling TotalAV

Conclusion
----------

Although TotalAV is a reliable security solution, occasional issues can arise due to software conflicts, outdated versions, incorrect permissions, or expired licenses. By following the steps outlined in this guide, users can identify and resolve most problems related to TotalAV not working. For persistent or advanced issues, direct contact with TotalAV's support team is recommended.

Proper installation, regular updates, and ensuring adequate system permissions will go a long way in maintaining the performance and reliability of TotalAV on all your devices.
